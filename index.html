            <h1>you choose to courageously trump forward. the doors creak open.. and slowly reveal the extravagant foyer of the palace. a breeze sends chills that dance along the curve of your spine. a smell of pine and a muffled rosy aroma fills your nose. the doors slam shut behind you, sending an echo that bounces off the walls. </h1>

            <h1> after lots of exploring the empty rooms, you stumble across what seems to be the throne room. your breath is caught in your throat. it's humungous, nothing like what the movies show. a figure standing in front of the throne turns their eyes to you and says, "we've been awaiting your arrival, you may now inherit the throne." </h1>

            <h1>after endless trails and going around for hours in what seemed to just be circles, the night was taking over. desperate for food and water, you listen and run towards the nearest source of water. to your luck, you are greeted by a hooded figure standing in the middle of the pond. in a croaking voice, they whisper, "i've been calling for you.. you've made it." before you could even react, it has both hands around your throat. you die. </h1>
